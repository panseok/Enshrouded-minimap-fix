# Enshrouded Minimap

Integrated in-game minimap mod for Enshrouded using Shroudtopia.

This is not an external Windows overlay. The mod hooks into the game client and
draws the minimap directly inside the Enshrouded frame.

## What It Does

- Shows a circular minimap on the right side of the screen.
- Defaults to the bottom-right corner and supports top-right, middle-right,
  and bottom-right placement.
- Uses a premium compass-style frame asset.
- Renders the real Embervale map at minimap scale.
- Shows the player's position and facing direction.
- Uses real map marker icons extracted from the game's map UI.
- Shows nearby points of interest that are visible or detected by the map.
- Uses fog-of-war and POI data as a fallback when the game does not expose all
  live markers.
- Renders inside the game's Vulkan frame without a separate overlay window.

## Controls

- `+` zooms in.
- `-` zooms out.
- `F10` toggles the minimap on/off without leaving the game.

The numpad `+`, `-`, and `*` keys also work.

## Download

Download the latest zip from the release page:

[Enshrouded Minimap v0.4.46](https://github.com/elxokker/Enshrouded-minimap/releases/tag/v0.4.46)

Release asset:

`enshrouded-minimap-v0.4.46.zip`

## Installing the Zip

1. Close Enshrouded.
2. Download `enshrouded-minimap-v0.4.46.zip`.
3. Extract the zip.
4. Copy the full `minimap_mod` folder to:

```text
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Enshrouded\mods\minimap_mod
```

The final folder should look like this:

```text
Enshrouded
+-- mods
    +-- minimap_mod
        +-- minimap_mod.dll
        +-- mod.json
        +-- embervale_minimap_frame.rgba
        +-- embervale_minimap_icons.bin
        +-- embervale_player_arrow.rgba
        +-- embervale_realmap_1280.rgba
        +-- ...
```

5. Start Enshrouded with Shroudtopia.

If you already had an older version installed, replace the whole `minimap_mod`
folder with the new one.

## Position Config

The minimap position is controlled from Shroudtopia's config file:

```text
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Enshrouded\shroudtopia.json
```

Set `mods.minimap_mod.position` to one of these values:

- `top-right`
- `middle-right`
- `bottom-right`

Example:

```json
{
  "mods": {
    "minimap_mod": {
      "active": true,
      "position": "bottom-right",
      "toggle_key": "F10",
      "render_camera_fallback": true,
      "debug_logging": false,
      "map_sample_step": 2,
      "max_icons": 64
    }
  }
}
```

The mod also reads `mods.minimap_mod.toggle_key` every second while active.
Recommended value: `F10`. Supported readable values include `F1`-`F24`,
`insert`, `delete`, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `backspace`, and
`numpad-*`.

`render_camera_fallback` is enabled by default. It lets the minimap recover its
player position from render data when a game update stops the normal UI position
feed from firing before the minimap draws.

The mod reads these values directly and refreshes them every second while active.
If the minimap is not loaded yet, start or restart the game after changing it.

## EML Compatibility Notes

This minimap is a native Shroudtopia mod. It is not an EML-native Lua mod and
EML does not load `minimap_mod.dll` by itself.

The release includes a no-op `src/mod.lua` and EML-neutral manifest fields so
EML setups that scan every folder under `mods/` do not treat `minimap_mod` as an
incomplete Lua package.

For mixed EML + Shroudtopia setups:

- Keep Shroudtopia installed with `winmm.dll` and `shroudtopia.dll`.
- Keep this mod at `mods/minimap_mod`.
- If EML with `dbghelp.dll` crashes on client startup, try EML's `dinput8.dll`
  proxy instead of `dbghelp.dll`, as recommended by EML's own troubleshooting.
- Do not expect an EML-only setup to load the minimap DLL. Shroudtopia is still
  required.

## Building From Source

Requirements:

- Windows.
- Visual Studio with MSBuild and the C++ toolset.
- Shroudtopia installed in the game folder to load the mod.

Build:

```powershell
.\build-release.ps1
```

Install to the default Steam path:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

Install to a custom Enshrouded path:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -GameDir "D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Enshrouded"
```

## Repository Layout

- `src/` - mod source code.
- `include/` - minimal Shroudtopia headers required to build.
- `assets/` - runtime assets copied next to the DLL.
- `build-release.ps1` - builds `Release|x64`.
- `install.ps1` - installs the mod and backs up the previous install.

## Version

Current mod version: `0.4.46`.

The mod resolves hook signatures near the known Enshrouded client addresses at
load time, which makes small game updates less likely to break the minimap.
Large game updates can still require structure offsets to be revalidated.
